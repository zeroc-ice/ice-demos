# IceGrid Greeter

The IceGrid Greeter demo illustrates how to call an Ice server managed by IceGrid from a client written in Ruby.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client(Client) --> | locate greeter | Locator
    subgraph Registry[IceGrid Registry]
        direction LR
        Locator[locator:4061]
    end
    Node[IceGrid Node]
    Server(Server<br/>hosts Chatbot)
    Registry <--> Node --> | activate | Server
    Locator -.-> |return greeter endpoints | Client
    Client ==> |greet request| Server
```

Ice for Ruby supports only client-side applications. As a result, you first need to deploy the IceGrid Greeter
server implemented in a language with server-side support, such as Python, Java, or C#.

Then, in a separate window:

- Compile Greeter.ice with the Slice to Ruby compiler into Greeter.rb

```shell
slice2rb Greeter.ice
```

- Run the client application

```shell
ruby client.rb
```
