# Ice for C# Demos

This folder contains example Ice applications written in C#. Each example is a simple client-server application that
demonstrates a specific feature or programming technique.

The MSBuild projects download and install the Ice for C# NuGet packages as needed. See [Ice for C# installation] for
details.
