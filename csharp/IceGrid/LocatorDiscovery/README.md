# IceGrid LocatorDiscovery

The LocatorDiscovery demo shows how to write a client application that configures its locator using the
LocatorDiscovery plugin.

This demo provides a new client application for the IceGrid/Greeter demo, and relies on IceGrid/Greeter for everything
else.

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

1. Build the [IceGrid/Greeter](../Greeter) demo.

2. Run icegridregistry, icegridnode, and configure IceGrid using icegridadmin as per the IceGrid Greeter demo
instructions.

3. Build and run the client application:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
