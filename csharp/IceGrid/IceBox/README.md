   ```

3. Start the IceGrid registry in its own terminal:

   ```shell
   icegridregistry --Ice.Config=config.registry
   ```

4. Start the IceGrid node in its own terminal:

   ```shell
   icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.node
   ```

5. Deploy the "GreeterHall" application in this IceGrid deployment:

   ```shell
   icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin -e "application add greeter-hall.xml"
   ```
