# IceGrid/Greeter

The IceGrid/Greeter demo illustrates how to create a very simple IceGrid deployment that manages a Greeter server.

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

1. Build the client and server applications:

```shell
dotnet build
```

2. Start the IceGrid registry in its own terminal:

```shell
icegridregistry --Ice.Config=config.registry
```

3. Start the IceGrid node in its own terminal:

```shell
icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.node
```

4. Deploy the "GreeterHall" application in this IceGrid deployment:

```shell
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin -e "application add greeter-hall.xml"
```

`greeter-hall.xml` configures a single Greeter server. As an alternative, you can deploy 3 replicated Greeter servers
with:

```shell
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin -e "application add greeter-hall-with-replication.xml"
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `update` instead of `add` to update an existing application.

5. Run the client application:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
