This demo shows a very simple [IceGrid deployment][1], with a single
[IceBox][2] server hosting a number of IceBox services.

The demo also shows how to use an environment variable in a server
descriptor.

In `application.xml`, `<env>LANG=en</env>` defines an environment variable
named `LANG` with value `en`. The Hello object implementation `HelloI`
reads the value of `LANG` and shows the message in the corresponding
language; you can try changing the value to `fr`, `de`, `es` or `it`.

## .NET Framework 4.5 Setup

Start the IceGrid registry and node:
```
icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid
```

Deploy the `HelloSimpsons` application (in file `application.xml`) with
the IceGrid GUI. If you prefer to use the command-line utility, use:

```
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application add application.xml"
```

## .NET 6 Setup

Start the IceGrid registry and node:
```
icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid
```

Deploy the `HelloSimpsons` application (in file `application-net6.xml`) with
the IceGrid GUI. If you prefer to use the command-line utility, use:
```
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application add application-net6.xml"
```

Using IceGrid GUI
-----------------

We suggest using the [IceGrid GUI][3] tool with this demo. Follow these steps
to log into the IceGrid registry and view the application you deployed above:

  - Launch the IceGrid GUI application using the IceGrid GUI icon from Start
    menu.

  - Select `Login...` from the `File menu`.

  - In the `Saved Connections` dialog, click `New Connection` to open
    the `New Connection` wizard.

  - Select `Direct Connection` and click `Next`.

  - Let the default value `Connect to Master Registry` checked
    and click `Next`.

  - On the `Discovered Registries` list select `DemoIceGrid/locator...` and
    click `Next`.

  - In next Window let the pre fill `IceGrid Registry Endpoint(s)` and click
    `Next`.

  - Enter any username and password combination and click `Finish`
    to log in.

  - Next time you want to connect, the connection will appear in the
    `Saved Connections` dialog, just select it and click `Connect`.

Running the Client
------------------

Start the client with:
```
client
```

> With .NET 6, use instead:
> ```
> dotnet client.dll
> ```

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.

Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You can use the IceGrid GUI or the command-line utility to stop
and restart IceBox services. The commands below show how to manipulate
the 'Lisa' service:
```
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid
>>> service stop IceBox Lisa
>>> service start IceBox Lisa
```

Administration through Glacier2
-------------------------------

This demo also includes the configuration for a [Glacier2 router][4] to
show how you could administer IceGrid from "the other side" of a firewall.
(In this demo, however, all the components run on the same system.)

Follow these steps:

 - Connect to the IceGrid registry with icegridadmin or the IceGrid GUI

 - Start the DemoGlacier2 server

 - Reconnect to the IceGrid registry, this time using a Glacier2
   session. For example, using the command-line utility you must
   supply a proxy for the router:
   ```
   icegridadmin --Ice.Default.Router="DemoGlacier2/router:tcp -h localhost -p 4063"
   ```
   In the IceGrid GUI, use the Routed tab of the Login dialog.
   Change the Glacier2 instance name to "DemoGlacier2" and the endpoints
   to `tcp -h localhost -p 4063`.

   DemoGlacier2 is configured to use a built-in permissions verifier
   that does not validate passwords, so you can log in using any
   username/password combination.
