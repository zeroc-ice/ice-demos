# Secure

This demo shows how to configure client and server applications to communicate over secure connections.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
