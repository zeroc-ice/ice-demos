# Ice Context

The Context demo shows the 3 different ways to set a request context in a client.

A request context is a `dictionary<string, string>` carried by all requests. It is empty by default, and the
application is free to set any entry in this dictionary.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ice protocol does not support response contexts, only request contexts.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
