This demo illustrates how to access a server's [Properties facet] in order to retrieve and modify its configuration
properties. This demo also shows how the server can receive notifications whenever its properties are changed.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```shell
dotnet server.dll
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```shell
dotnet client.dll
```
