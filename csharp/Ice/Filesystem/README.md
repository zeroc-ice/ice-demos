# Ice Filesystem

The Filesystem demo shows how to write a simple filesystem application using interface inheritance.

You can build the client and server applications with:

```shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
