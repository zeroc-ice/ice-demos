This demo illustrates the use of [Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI)] with a server that performs simple calculations
and a client that can call for the calculations without blocking.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```shell
dotnet server.dll
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```shell
dotnet client.dll
```
