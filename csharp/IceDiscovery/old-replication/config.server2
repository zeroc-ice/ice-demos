# The server creates one single object adapter with the name "Hello".
#
# The following configures the object adapter. We set endpoints with
# no fixed port and we assign it a unique adapter ID that will be
# embedded in indirect proxies.
#
# We also configure the replica group ID, object adapters sharing the
# same replica group ID are part of the same replica group. When the
# client resolves an indirect proxy refering to this replica group,
# the locator implementation will return the endpoints of all the
# object adapters part of the replica group.
