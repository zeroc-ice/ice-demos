This example demonstrates the use of several Glacier2 features, including
[callbacks][1] and [request contexts][2].

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
server
```
In a separate window, start the Glacier2 router:
```
glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2
```
In a separate window, start the client:
```
client
```

> With .NET 6, use instead:
> ```
> dotnet server.dll
> ```
> and
> ```
> dotnet client.dll
> ```
> to start the server and client.

If you plan to run this demo using clients on different hosts than the
router, you must first modify the configuration. You need to change
the `Glacier2.Client.Endpoints` property in `config.glacier2` and the
`Ice.Default.Router` property in `config.client`. In all cases you must
set the host parameter of the `-h host` endpoint option to the actual
address of the machine on which glacier2router is running.
