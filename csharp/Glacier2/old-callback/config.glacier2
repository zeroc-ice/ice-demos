# visible from the public Internet, and it should be secure.

# The server-visible endpoint of Glacier2. This endpoint is only
# required if callbacks are needed (leave empty otherwise). This
# should be an endpoint on an internal network (like 192.168.x.x), or
# on the loopback, so that the server is not directly accessible from
# the Internet.

#
# Glacier can forward requests buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered
# means a lower resource consumption, as buffering requires one
# additional thread per connected client or server. However, without
# buffering, messages cannot be batched and message overriding doesn't
# work either. Also, with unbuffered request forwarding, the caller
# thread blocks for twoway requests.
# The default is to use buffering (=1), in both directions.
#Glacier2.Client.Buffered=0
#Glacier2.Server.Buffered=0

#
# These two lines instruct Glacier2 to forward contexts both for
# regular routing, as well as for callbacks (reverse routing).
#

Glacier2.Server.ForwardContext=1

#
# To prevent Glacier2 from being flooded with requests from or to one
# particular client, Glacier2 can be configured to sleep for a certain
# period after all current requests for this client have been
# forwarded. During this sleep period, new requests for the client are
# queued. These requests are then all sent once the sleep period is
# over. The unit is milliseconds.
#
Glacier2.Client.SleepTime=500
Glacier2.Server.SleepTime=500

#
# With the two settings below, Glacier2 can be instructed to always
# batch oneways, even if they are sent with a _fwd/o instead of a
# _fwd/O context.
# The default value for Glacier2.Client.AlwaysBatch and
# Glacier2.Server.AlwaysBatch is 0.
#Glacier2.Client.AlwaysBatch=1
#Glacier2.Server.AlwaysBatch=1

#
# Glacier2 always disables active connection management so there is no
# need to configure this manually. Connection retry does not need to
# be disabled, as it's safe for Glacier2 to retry outgoing connections
# to servers. Retry for incoming connections from clients must be
# disabled in the clients.
