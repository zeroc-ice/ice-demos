This demo implements the simple filesystem application shown at the end of the [client] and [server] C# mapping
chapters.

To run the demo, first change to the Server directory and start the server:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet server.dll
```

In a separate window, change to the Client directory and start the client:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet client.dll
```
