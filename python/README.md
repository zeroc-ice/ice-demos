# Ice for Python Demos

This folder contains example Ice applications written in Python. Each example is a simple client-server application that
demonstrates a specific feature or programming technique.

## Building Requirements

1. **Python**
   Python 3.12 or later. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **ZeroC Nightly Pypi Respository**
   The projects are setup to use Ice for Python nightly builds from the ZeroC nightly PYPI repository.
   See [Installing Nightly Builds](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/blob/main/NIGHTLY.md#python) for setup instructions.

## Building the demos

Follow the instructions provided in each demoâ€™s README.md file.
