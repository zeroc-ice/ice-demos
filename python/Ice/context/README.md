# Ice Context

The Context demo shows the three different ways to set a request context in a client.

A request context is a `dictionary<string, string>` carried by all requests. It is empty by default, and the
application is free to set any entry in this dictionary.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ice protocol does not support response contexts, only request contexts.

## Prerequisites

- Install uv. See [Installing uv].

## Running the server

Navigate to the `server` directory.

### 1. Compile the Slice definitions

Use the Slice-to-Python compiler to generate Python code from the `Greeter.ice` file:

```shell
uv run slice2py ../slice/Greeter.ice
```

### 2. Run the server

```shell
uv run main.py
```

## Running the client

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` directory.

### 1. Compile the Slice definitions

Use the Slice-to-Python compiler to generate Python code from the `Greeter.ice` file:

```shell
uv run slice2py ../slice/Greeter.ice
```

### 2. Run the client

```shell
uv run main.py
```
