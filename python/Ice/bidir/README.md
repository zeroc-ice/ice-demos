# Bidir

The Bidir demo illustrates how to send requests "the other way around", from a server to a client, by reusing the
connection established by the client to the server.

This demo is very similar to the [Callback][1] demo: with the Callback demo, the server opens a connection to the

client, while with this demo, there is only one connection, from the client to the server:

    c[Client<br>hosts AlarmClock] --bidir connection--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts WakeUpService]
```

This is particularly useful when the client application is behind a firewall that does not allow incoming connections.

We recommend running each program in a separate Python virtual environment.  
If you are new to Python virtual environments, see [Python Virtual Environments].

## Running the server

Navigate to the `server` directory.

### 1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

#### macOS and Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install program dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Compile the Slice definitions

Use the Slice-to-Python compiler to generate Python code from the `AlarmClock.ice` file:

```bash
slice2py ../slice/AlarmClock.ice
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running the client

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` directory.

### 1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment

#### macOS and Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install program dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Compile the Slice definitions

Use the Slice-to-Python compiler to generate Python code from the `AlarmClock.ice` file:

```bash
slice2py ../slice/AlarmClock.ice
```

### 4. Run the client

```bash
python main.py
```
