# Glacier2 Callback

This demo shows how to write a client that establishes a session with a Glacier2 router. It also shows how to implement
callbacks in this client.

This demo is similar to the [Ice Callback][1] demo, except all communications go through the Glacier router.

The connection between the client and the Glacier2 router is a "bidir" connection, like in the [Ice Bidir][2] demo:

```mermaid

    c[Client<br>hosts AlarmClock] --bidir connection--> g[Glacier2 router:4063]
    g --connection1--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts WakeUpService] --connection2--> g
```

We recommend running each program in a separate Python virtual environment. If you are new to Python virtual
environments, see [Python Virtual Environments].

## Running the server

Navigate to the `server` directory, to run the server program.

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

- Install the program dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Compile the AlarmClock.ice file with the Slice compiler for Python:

    ```shell
    slice2py ../slice/AlarmClock.ice
    ```

- Run the server program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```

- Start the Glacier2 router in its own terminal:

   ```shell
   glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also start the Glacier2 router before the server. The order does not matter: the server is identical to the
   > server provided in the [Ice Callback][1] demo and does not depend on Glacier2.

## Running the client

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` directory to run the client program.

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

- Install the program dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Compile the AlarmClock.ice file with the Slice compiler for Python:

    ```shell
    slice2py ../slice/AlarmClock.ice
    ```

- Run the client program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
