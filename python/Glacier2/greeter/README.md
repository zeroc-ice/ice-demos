# Glacier2 Greeter

This demo shows how to write a client that calls an Ice object hosted in a server "behind" a Glacier 2 router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    c[Client] --tcp--> g[Glacier2 router:4063] --tcp--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts Greeter]
```

In a typical Glacier2 deployment, the client can establish a connection to the Glacier2 router but cannot establish
a connection to the server, because the server is on a separate network.

We recommend running each program in a separate Python virtual environment. If you are new to Python virtual
environments, see [Python Virtual Environments].

## Running the server

Navigate to the `server` directory to run the server program.

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

- Install the program dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Compile the Greeter.ice file with the Slice compiler for Python:

    ```shell
    slice2py ../slice/Greeter.ice
    ```

- Run the server program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```

- Start the Glacier2 router in its own terminal:

   ```shell
   glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also start the Glacier2 router before the server. The order does not matter: the server is identical to the
   > server provided in the [Ice Greeter] demo and does not depend on Glacier2.

## Running the client

In a separate terminal, navigate to the `client` directory to run the client program.

- Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

- Install the program dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Compile the Greeter.ice file with the Slice compiler for Python:

    ```shell
    slice2py ../slice/Greeter.ice
    ```

- Run the client program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
