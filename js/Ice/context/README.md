# Ice Context

This demo illustrates how to use Ice request contexts.

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

1\. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

2\. Build the client application:

```shell
npm run build
```

3\. Run the server application:

Ice for JavaScript has limited server-side support. As a result, you need to start a Context server implemented in a
language that fully supports server-side functionality, such as Python, Java, or C#.

4\. Run the client application:

```shell
node client.js
```
