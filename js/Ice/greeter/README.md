# Ice Greeter

This demo shows how to send a request and wait for a response using Ice for JavaScript. It includes a Node.js client
application.

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. Build the client application:

> language with full server-side support, such as C++, C#, Java, Python, or Swift.
