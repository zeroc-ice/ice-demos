# Ice React Greeter

This demo shows how to send a request and wait for a response using Ice for JavaScript. It includes a React client
application that runs in the browser.

Follow these steps to build and run the demo:

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the server application:

    Ice for JavaScript has limited server-side support ([see documentation][1]). As a result, you need to start a
    Config server implemented in a language that fully supports server-side functionality, such as Python, Java, or C#.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Pass `--Ice.Default.Protocol=ws` to the server to instruct it to use the `ws` protocol required for communication with
    > the browser client. We use the Ice **Config server** instead of the plain Ice **Greeter server** because it allows us
    > to specify `ws` via command-line arguments without modifying the code.

3. Run the client application in development mode:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the URL shown in the terminal).
