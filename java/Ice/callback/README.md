# Ice Callback

The Callback demo illustrates how to implement callbacks in a client application.

In this demo, the client hosts an alarm clock (an Ice object), and asks the server's wake up service to call this
object at a later time. The server opens a TCP connection to the client when making this call.

    c[Client<br>hosts AlarmClock] --connection1--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts WakeUpService]
    s --connection2--> c
```

## Building the Project

This project uses Gradle and the [Application plugin]. To build the client and server applications, run:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

This will compile each project and install the distributions in the `build/install` subdirectory of each project.

## Running the Server

First, start the server application:

```shell
./gradlew :server:run --quiet
```

## Running the Client

Then, in a separate terminal, start the client application:

```shell
./gradlew :client:run --quiet
```
