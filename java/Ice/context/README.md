# Ice Context

The Context demo shows the 3 different ways to set a request context in a client.

A request context is a `dictionary<string, string>` carried by all requests. It is empty by default, and the application
is free to set any entry in this dictionary.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ice protocol does not support response contexts, only request contexts.

## Building the Project

This project uses Gradle and the [Application plugin]. To build the client and server applications, run:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

This will compile each project.

## Running the Server

First, start the server application:

```shell
./gradlew :server:run --quiet
```

## Running the Client

Then, in a separate terminal, start the client application:

```shell
./gradlew :client:run --quiet
```
