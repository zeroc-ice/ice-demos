# Ice Context

The Context demo shows the 3 different ways to set a request context in a client.

A request context is a `dictionary<string, string>` carried by all requests. It is empty by default, and the application
is free to set any entry in this dictionary.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ice protocol does not support response contexts, only request contexts.

## Building the demo

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, run all the commands below in Git Bash or PowerShell; they don't work in the cmd.exe Command Prompt.

The demo has two Gradle projects, **client** and **server**, both using the [application plugin].

To build the demo, run:

```shell
./gradlew installDist
```

This creates a self-contained distribution under build/install/ for each application, with launcher scripts in its
bin/ directory.

## Running the demo

First, start the server application:

```shell
./server/build/install/server/bin/server
```

Then, in a separate terminal, start the client application:

```shell
./client/build/install/client/bin/client
```
