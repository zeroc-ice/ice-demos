# IceGrid Greeter

The IceGrid Greeter demo illustrates how to create a very simple IceGrid deployment that manages a Greeter server.

```

## Ice prerequisites

- Install IceGrid. See [Ice service installation].

## Building the Project

This project uses Gradle and the [Application plugin]. To build the client and server applications, run:

```shell
./gradlew installDist
```

This creates a self-contained distribution under build/install/ for each application.
Each distribution includes:

- a bin/ directory with start scripts, and
- a lib/ directory containing the application JAR and all its runtime dependencies.

In our IceGrid deployment, we call java directly and set the class path to include everything in the distributionâ€™s lib/
directory. This ensures both the server JAR and its dependencies (such as Ice) are available at runtime.

## Running the demo

First, start the IceGrid registry in its own terminal:

```shell
icegridregistry --Ice.Config=config.registry
```

Then, start the IceGrid node in its own terminal:

```shell
icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.node
```

Next, deploy the "GreeterHall" application in this IceGrid deployment:

```shell
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin -e "application add greeter-hall.xml"
```

`greeter-hall.xml` configures a single Greeter server. As an alternative, you can deploy 3 replicated Greeter servers
with:

```shell
icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin -e "application add greeter-hall-with-replication.xml"
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `update` instead of `add` to update an existing application.

Finally, run the client application:

```shell
./gradlew :client:run --quiet
```
