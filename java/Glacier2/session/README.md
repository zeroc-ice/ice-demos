# Glacier2 Session

This demo shows how to implement and configure a Session Manager with Glacier2. A Session Manager creates
application-level session objects that typically maintain some per-session state.

This demo also illustrates how to use a default servant that implements multiple objects (see the SharedPokeBox class).

In the demo, the client catches PokÃ©mon and stores them in a PokeBox hosted by the server behind the Glacier2 router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    c[Client] --tcp--> g[Glacier2 router:4063] --tcp--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts SessionManager, PokeSession, PokeBox]
```

In a typical Glacier2 deployment, the client can establish a connection to the Glacier2 router but cannot establish
a connection to the server, because the server is on a separate network.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install Glacier2. See [Ice service installation].

## Building the demo

The demo has two Gradle projects, **client** and **server**, both using the [application plugin].

To build the demo, run:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Running the demo

Start the Server program in its own terminal:

```shell
./gradlew :server:run --quiet
```

Next, start the Glacier2 router in its own terminal:

```shell
glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also start the Glacier2 router before the server. The order does not matter.

Finally, in a separate terminal, run the client application several times:

```shell
./gradlew :client:run --quiet ash
./gradlew :client:run --quiet ash
./gradlew :client:run --quiet ash
```

If you don't specify a name, the client uses the current username.
