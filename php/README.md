# PHP Demos

## Overview

This directory contains PHP sample programs for various Ice components. These
examples are provided to get you started on using a particular Ice feature or
coding technique.

The following subdirectories contain sample programs:

- [Chat](./Chat) contains a GUI client for the ZeroC [Chat Demo][1].

- [Glacier2](./Glacier2) has an example that maintains a Glacier2 session.

- [Ice](./Ice) has several examples that illustrate fundamental Ice concepts.

- [IceDiscovery](./IceDiscovery) demonstrates the use of our multicast service
discovery plug-in.

## Compiling the Slice files

Each demo contains one or more [Slice][2] files. You need to compile these Slice
files into PHP code before running the demo. You can either run `slice2php`
yourself as shown in the demo's README.md file, or compile all the demo Slice
files by executing the `build.php` script:
```
php build.php
```

`build.php` is a simple PHP script that runs `slice2php` on all the demo
Slice files. The companion script `clean.php` removes all the files generated by
`slice2php`.

If you install Ice in a non-standard location, set the `ICE_HOME` environment
variable to this installation directory before executing `build.php`.

## Running the Demos

Refer to the README.md file in each demo directory for usage instructions.
