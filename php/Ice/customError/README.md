# Ice Custom Error

The Custom error demo shows how to define an exception in Slice, and how to throw and catch this exception.

A Slice-defined exception should be seen as a custom error carried by the response instead of the expected return
value--there is naturally no throwing across the network.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the PHP dev kit. See [Ice for PHP installation].

## Building and running the demo

Ice for PHP supports only client-side applications. As a result, you first need to start a Custom Error server
implemented in a language with server-side support, such as Python, Java, or C#.

Then, in a separate window:

- Compile Greeter.ice with the Slice to PHP compiler into Greeter.php

```shell
slice2php Greeter.ice
```

- Run the client application

```shell
php Client.php
```
