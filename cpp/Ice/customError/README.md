# Ice Custom Error

The Custom error demo shows how to define an exception in Slice, and how to throw and catch this exception.

A Slice-defined exception should be seen as a custom error carried by the response instead of the expected return
value--there is naturally no throwing across the network.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the C++ dev kit.
  - Linux and macOS: see [Ice for C++ installation].
  - Windows: the cmake build downloads and installs the C++ dev kit automatically.

## Building the demo

Configure the build:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja
```

On Windows, to get stack traces at runtime, you can download and copy the Ice PDB files to the build output directory
with the following configure command instead:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja -DICE_COPY_PDB=ON
```

Build the demo:

```shell
cmake --build build
```

## Running the demo

To run the demo, first start the server:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/server
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/client
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\client
```
