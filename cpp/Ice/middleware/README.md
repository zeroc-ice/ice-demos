# Middleware

The Middleware demo shows how to write a simple middleware and how to add this middleware to an object adapter.

Each object adapter maintains a dispatch pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    client[Client] -- request --> am -- response --> client
    subgraph pipeline [Dispatch pipeline]
        direction LR
        am[Authorization <br>middleware] --> om[Other <br>middleware] --> Servant --> om --> am
    end
```

> [!NOTE]
> Other middleware is just an example, and is not provided by this demo.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the C++ dev kit.
  - Linux and macOS: see [Ice for C++ installation].
  - Windows: the cmake build downloads and installs the C++ dev kit automatically.

## Building the demo

To build the demo, run:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

## Running the demo

To run the demo, first start the server:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/server
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/client
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\client
```
