# Context

The Context demo shows the 3 different ways to set a request context in a client.

A request context is a `dictionary<string, string>` carried by all requests. It is empty by default, and the
application is free to set any entry in this dictionary.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the C++ dev kit.
  - Linux and macOS: see [Ice for C++ installation].
  - Windows: the cmake build downloads and installs the C++ dev kit automatically.

## Building the demo

To build the demo, run:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

## Running the demo

To run the demo, first start the server:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/server
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/client
```

**Windows:**
