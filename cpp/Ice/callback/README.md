# Callback

The Callback demo illustrates how to implement callbacks in a client application.

In this demo, the client hosts an alarm clock (an Ice object), and asks the server's wake up service to call this
object at a later time. The server opens a TCP connection to the client when making this call.

    c[Client<br>hosts AlarmClock] --connection1--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts WakeUpService]
    s --connection2--> c
```

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the C++ dev kit.
  - Linux and macOS: see [Ice for C++ installation].
  - Windows: the cmake build downloads and installs the C++ dev kit automatically.

## Building the demo

To build the demo, run:

```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Running the demo

To run the demo, first start the server:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/server
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\Release\server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

**Linux/macOS:**

```shell
./build/client
```

**Windows:**

```shell
build\Release\client
```
