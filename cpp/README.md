## Overview

This directory contains C++ sample programs for various Ice components. These examples
are provided to get you started on using a particular Ice feature or coding technique.

The subdirectories here correspond directly to Ice components, such as
[IceGrid](./IceGrid) and [Glacier2](./Glacier2).

Refer to the README.md file in each demo directory for usage instructions.

## macOS Prerequisites

- macOS Sequoia
- Xcode
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- CMake
- [Nightly build of Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/blob/main/NIGHTLY.md#macos)

## Linux Prerequisites

- A supported Linux Distribution (RHEL 9/10, Amazon Linux 2023, Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04)
- GCC C++ Toolchain
- CMake
- [Nightly build of Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/blob/main/NIGHTLY.md#linux)

## Windows Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake (installed via Visual Studio installer)
- [Nightly build of Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/blob/main/NIGHTLY.md#windows)

The CMake script will automatically download the required NuGet packages when you
build the demos. The NuGet packages are cached the [cmake](./cmake) directory.
