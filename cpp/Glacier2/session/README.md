# Glacier2 Session

This demo shows how to implement and configure a Session Manager with Glacier2. A Session Manager creates
application-level session objects that typically maintain some per-session state.

This demo also illustrates how to use a default servant that implements multiple objects (see the SharedPokeBox class).

In the demo, the client catches PokÃ©mon and stores them in a PokeBox hosted by the server behind the Glacier2 router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    c[Client] --tcp--> g[Glacier2 router:4063] --tcp--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts SessionManager, PokeSession, PokeBox]
```

In a typical Glacier2 deployment, the client can establish a connection to the Glacier2 router but cannot establish
a connection to the server, because the server is on a separate network.

## Ice prerequisites

- Install the C++ dev kit.
  - Linux and macOS: see [Ice for C++ installation].
  - Windows: the cmake build downloads and installs the C++ dev kit automatically.
- Install Glacier2. See [Ice service installation].

## Building the demo

To build the demo, run:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

## Running the demo

1. Start the server in its own terminal:

   **Linux/macOS:**

   ```shell
   ./build/server
   ```

   **Windows:**

   ```shell
   build\server
   ```

2. Start the Glacier2 router in its own terminal:

   ```shell
   glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also start the Glacier2 router before the server. The order does not matter.

3. Finally, run the client application several times:

    **Linux/macOS:**

    ```shell
    ./build/client ash
    ./build/client ash
    ./build/client ash
    ```

    **Windows:**

    ```shell
    build\client ash
    build\client ash
    build\client ash
    ```

    If you don't specify a name, the client uses the current username.
