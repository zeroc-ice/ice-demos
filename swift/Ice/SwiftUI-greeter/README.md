# SwiftUI Greeter

This demo shows how to send a request and receive a response using Ice for Swift in a SwiftUI application.

The client is implemented using SwiftUI and can be run on **macOS**, the **iOS Simulator**, or a
**physical iOS device**.

## Getting Started

1. Start the [Greeter server](../greeter) from the `greeter` directory.
2. Open the `SwiftUI-greeter` project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on your platform of choice (macOS, iOS device, or iOS simulator).
