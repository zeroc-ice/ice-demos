# Ice throughput

A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various types between client and server and to measure the
maximum bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```shell
.build/debug/Server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```shell
.build/debug/Client
```
