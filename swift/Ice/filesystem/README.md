# Ice Filesystem

This demo shows the power of interface inheritance in Slice.

It illustrates how to implement Slice interfaces using actors, and how to reuse the servant implementation for a base
interface using delegation.

You can build the client and server applications with:

```shell
swift build
```

You can start the Server program with:

```shell
swift run Server
```

Then, in a separate terminal, start the Client program with:

```shell
swift run Client
```
