# GreeterApp

This demo shows how to send a request and receive a response using Ice for Swift in a SwiftUI application.

The client is implemented using SwiftUI and can be run on **macOS**, the **iOS Simulator**, or a
**physical iOS device**.

## Getting Started

1. Start the [Greeter server](../Greeter) from the `Greeter` directory.
2. Open the `GreeterApp` project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on your platform of choice (macOS, iOS device, or iOS simulator).

>![IMPORTANT]
> On the first build attempt, you may see the message:
> _"Plugin “CompileSlice” from package “ice” must be enabled before it can be used."_
> Click on the message in Xcode to enable the plugin.
