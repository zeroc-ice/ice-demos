# Greeter

The Greeter demo illustrates how to send a request and wait for the response.

You can build the client and server applications with:

```shell
swift build
```

You can start the Server program with:

```shell
swift run Server
```

Then, in a separate terminal, start the Client program with:

```shell
swift run Client
```
