# Ice Callback

The Callback demo illustrates how to implement callbacks in a client application.

In this demo, the client hosts an alarm clock (an Ice object), and asks the server's wake up service to call this
object at a later time. The server opens a TCP connection to the client when making this call.

```mermaid

    c[Client<br>hosts AlarmClock] --connection1--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts WakeUpService]
    s --connection2--> c
```

You can build the client and server applications with:

```shell
swift build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
swift run Server
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
swift run Client
```
