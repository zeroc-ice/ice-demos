# Manual simpleFilesystem

This demo implements the simple filesystem application shown at the end of the client and server Swift mapping chapters.

To run it, start the server in a window:

```shell
.build/debug/Server
```

Then run the client in a separate window:

```shell
.build/debug/Client
```
