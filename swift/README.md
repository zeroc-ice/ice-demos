# Ice for Swift Demos

This folder contains example Ice applications written in Swift. Each example is a simple client-server application that
demonstrates a specific feature or programming technique.

> Ice for Swift is only supported on macOS and iOS platforms.

## Building the Demos

Follow the instructions provided in each demoâ€™s README.md file.
