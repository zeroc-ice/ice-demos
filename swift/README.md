# Swift Demos

This directory contains Swift sample programs for various Ice components. These examples are provided to get you
started on using a particular Ice feature or coding technique.

Most of the subdirectories here correspond directly to Ice components, such as [Glacier2], [IceStorm], and so on.
The [Manual] directory contains complete examples for some of the code snippets in the [Ice manual].

Refer to the [C++11 demos] for more examples that use the Ice services (Glacier2, IceGrid, IceStorm).
