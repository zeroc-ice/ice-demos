This repository contains demo applications for the Ice framework. Each supported language has a corresponding top-level
directory containing its demos. For example, the C++ demos are located in the `cpp` directory. Each of these
directories contains a `README.md` file. Each README.md should contain a table of contents with links to the demos in the
corresponding subdirectories.

All CMake source directory entries in the VS Code settings file (`.vscode/settings.json`) correspond to actual
directories with CMakeLists.txt files. All demo directories with CMakeLists.txt files should appear in the
VS Code CMake settings.

Each CMakeLists.txt should have a contain a unique project name.
