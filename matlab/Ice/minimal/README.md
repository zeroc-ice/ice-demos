This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality, therefore
you must use a server from any other language mapping. If you want to get
started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
client
```

Note that this demo uses port 10000. If port 10000 is not available on your
machine, you need to edit both client and server to use a free port.

The demo also assumes the client and server are running on the same host.
To run the demo on separate hosts, edit the server to remove `-h localhost`
from the object adapter's endpoint, and edit the client to replace `localhost`
with the host name or IP address of the server.
