This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
well as how to make [oneway][1], [datagram][2], [secure][3], and
[batched][4] invocations.

To run the demo, first you need to start an Ice hello server from
another language mapping (Java, C++, C#, or Python). If you want
to get started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.
